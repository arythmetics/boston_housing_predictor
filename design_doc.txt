FastAPI over Flask
Reasons for:
- This is a microservice not a full blown application. FastAPI is a leaner tool for that specific purpose.
- Can be integrated with Pydantic for user input data validation.
- Has performance similar to high-speed web APIs in Node or Go
Reasons against:
- Flask is a far more mature tool than FastAPI. This means support and information is far more rich for Flask over FastAPI.
