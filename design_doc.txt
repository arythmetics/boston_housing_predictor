- JSON input of house specifications
- Dockerized
- curl testable API w/ Fast API
- Log of model accuracy with MLFlow
- Automatic numbered model artifact storage with comparison
- Hash table with stored predictions

FastAPI over Flask
Reasons for:
- This is a microservice not a full blown application. FastAPI is a leaner tool for that specific purpose.
- Can be integrated with Pydantic for user input data validation.
- Has performance similar to high-speed web APIs in Node or Go
Reasons against:
- Flask is a far more mature tool than FastAPI. This means support and information is far more rich for Flask over FastAPI.

Request Datatype in CSV vs JSON
- Would've preferred both
- CSV needs to be read in as SpooledTemporaryFile, which has a read error when 
attempting to be accessed by certain modules (in this case pandas)
- Left it as a TODO for a future version of this microservice
